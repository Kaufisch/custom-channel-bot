# CustomChannels
## What is CustomChannels?
With Custom Channels users can create their own temporary voice channels just like on Teamspeak.
They can change the name and size of the channel.
Furthermore, they can ban users from their channels and give the leadership of the channel to someone else.
## How it works!
The bot automatically creates the necessary channels when it joins the guild.
When you're joining the master channel, the bot creates a new channel with your name and moves you into that.
Then you can use several commands to modify this channel.
## Commands
### Channel commands | (These commands only work in the text-channel created by the bot)
- `>name name` Name your channel
- `>size 1-16` Change channel size
- `>ban @user` Ban sb. from your channel
- `>unban @user` Unban sb. who is banned
- `>leader @user` Change the leadership of your channel
### Admin commands
- `>help` Shows all Admin commands
- `>recreate` Recreate the channel of the bot if you deleted one of them
- `>prefix newPrefix` Change the prefix of the bot
- `>lang id` Change the language of the bot
